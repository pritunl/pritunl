specified in the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR 744).

By accepting this license agreement you confirm that you are not located in
(or a national resident of) any country under U.S. economic embargo, not

Software available on this web site contains cryptography and is therefore
subject to US government export control under the U.S. Export Administration
Regulations ("EAR"). EAR Part 740.13(e) allows the export and reexport of
publicly available encryption source code that is not subject to payment of
license fee or royalty payment. Object code resulting from the compiling of
such source code may also be exported and reexported under this provision if
publicly available and not subject to a fee or payment other than reasonable
and customary fees for reproduction and distribution. This kind of encryption
source code and the corresponding object code may be exported or reexported
without prior U.S. government export license authorization provided that the
U.S. government is notified about the Internet location of the software.

The software available on this web site is publicly available without license
fee or royalty payment, and all binary software is compiled from the source
code. The U.S. government has been notified about this site and the location
site for the source code. Therefore, the source code and compiled object code
may be downloaded and exported under U.S. export license exception (without a
U.S. export license) in accordance with the further restrictions outlined
above regarding embargoed countries, restricted persons and restricted end
uses.

Local Country Import Requirements. The software you are about to download
contains cryptography technology. Some countries regulate the import, use
and/or export of certain products with cryptography. Pritunl makes no
claims as to the applicability of local country import, use and/or export
regulations in relation to the download of this product. If you are located
outside the U.S. and Canada you are advised to consult your local country
regulations to insure compliance.
